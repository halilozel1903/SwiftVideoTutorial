An AVPlayer is a controller object used to manage the playback and timing of a media asset. You can use an AVPlayer to play local and remote file-based media, such as QuickTime movies and MP3 audio files, as well as audiovisual media served using HTTP Live Streaming.

AVPlayer is for playing a single media asset at a time. You can reuse the player instance to play additional media assets using its replaceCurrentItem(with:) method, but it manages the playback of only a single media asset at a time. The framework also provides a subclass of AVPlayer, called AVQueuePlayer, you use to create and manage the queuing of media assets played sequentially.

You use an AVPlayer to play media assets, which AVFoundation models using the AVAsset class. AVAsset only models the static aspects of the media, such as its duration or creation date, and on its own, is unsuitable for playback with an AVPlayer. To play an asset, you need to create an instance of its dynamic counterpart found in AVPlayerItem. This object models the timing and presentation state of an asset played by an instance of AVPlayer. See the AVPlayerItem reference for more details.
